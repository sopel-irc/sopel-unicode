# sopel-unicode

[Sopel] plugin for information lookup on Unicode codepoints.

This plugin is designed as a drop-in replacement for the built-in `unicode_info` plugin.

* The [General Category] of each codepoint
* Optional support for Unicode Character Database (UCD) versions newer than the Python release used to run Sopel, if [`unicodedata2`] is available
* Optional support for reporting the Unicode version that introduced each codepoint, if [`unicode_age`] is available

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

### Optional features

`sopel-unicode` is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the original built-in plugin on a basic installation.
To enable all the optional features:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-unicode[all]
```
